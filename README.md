## Base

The robot base is solid, so it holds the circuit board, motors, and batteries.

**Printing Instructions:**

| Prusa MK3                 |                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Fill density              | 100%                       |
| Support                   | Support on the build plate |
| Brim                      | Enabled                    |
| First Layer Speed         | 10                         |
| Number of pieces on plate | 1                          |

**In this piece we have five hex nuts: 1 to hold the circuit board and 4 to keep the motors, to fit these parts into the print we use Prusa Color and have the printer make two stops to put the nuts.**
